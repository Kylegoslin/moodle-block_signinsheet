Sign In Sheet block allows you to generate attendance lists for your students.

A list of students with a space for a signature is generated for printing based on enrolments. 


Additional information about the course name and the current date is added to the top of the sheet, allowing for easy tracking of printed lists.

You can easily order by First name or Last Name and filter by Course Groups that have been defined on your course page.
