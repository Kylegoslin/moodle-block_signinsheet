Sign In Sheet block allows you to generate attendance lists for your students.

Each of the students which are currently added to a course page will have their name and blank line which allows them to sign their name to indicate that they attended a class. This physical sign in is requirement which is needed in some institutes. 

Additional information about the course name and the current date is added to the top of the sheet, allowing for easy tracking of printed lists.

You can easily order by First name or Last Name and filter by Course Groups that have been defined on your course page. 

This block uses the existing core Moodle user and course enrolment information.
